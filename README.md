EXPERIMENT-3 | JEGO MARCO E. GODOY | 2ECE-A

****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ******************
________________________________________________________________
The Pandas Library application is the main topic of Experiment 3. The purpose of this project is to use the Pandas Library to create a Python program by identifying and applying various codes and functions.

This experiment comprises 2 problems, namely:
(1) PROBLEM 1 - where I used the file "cars.csv" and uploaded its data into a data frame using pandas, and got the first and last 5 rows.

(2) PROBLEM 2 - where I used the same data frame from problem 1 (cars) and performed the operations, subsetting, slicing, and indexing


********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
__________________________________________________________________
For Problem 1,
-- > I started by uploading the "cars.csv" file's data into the "cars" data frame.

-- >  I then used the steps "cars.head()" and "cars.tail()" to obtain the data frame's first and last five rows.



For Problem 2,

-- > I used the "cars" data frame from Problem 1 to carry out what was required on the data frame.


--> (a.) display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.


-- > (b.) Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’


-- > (c.) How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?


-- > (d.) Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’, and ‘Honda Civic’ have.


********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************
______________________________________________________________
Using this experiment, I learned how to:

(a.) to recognize and use different Pandas Library codes and characteristics


(b.) to be able to use and utilize the many codes and functions while using the Pandas Library to create a Python program.
